The Tourism Agency Management System is a web application developed by myself and my colleague, @aminasahovic, using Angular for the frontend and .NET with repository pattern for the backend. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing the operations of a tourism agency, facilitating efficient management of offers, accommodations, and reports.

Key Features:

  Offer Management: The system allows users to browse and explore various tourism offers provided by the agency. Users can view detailed information about destinations, itineraries, prices, and other relevant details.

  Custom Offer Creation: Users have the ability to create their own customized travel packages by selecting specific destinations, accommodations, activities, and transportation options. The system provides a user-friendly interface for personalizing the travel experience.
  
Overall, the Tourism Agency Management System offers a user-friendly interface for customers to explore and create personalized travel packages, while empowering agency employees with efficient management tools and reporting capabilities. The use of Angular for the frontend and .NET with repository pattern for the backend ensures a robust and scalable solution for the tourism agency's operations.
